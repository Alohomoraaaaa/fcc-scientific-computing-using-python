# 🧩 Sudoku Solver  

A Python program that solves a 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using recursion and backtracking.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- 🏗️ Classes & Objects for structuring the Sudoku grid  
- 🔄 Recursion for exploring possible solutions  
- ✅ Backtracking for correcting invalid choices  
- 🎯 Abstraction & Reusability through OOP  

Classes and objects are important programming concepts. These Object-Oriented Programming tools help developers to achieve code modularity, abstraction, and readability. And they promote reusability.  

In this Sudoku Solver project, you'll learn how to use classes and objects to build a Sudoku grid and to solve a Sudoku puzzle.
