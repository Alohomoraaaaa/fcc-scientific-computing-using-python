# Case Converter 🔤

A simple Python program that converts strings from **CamelCase/PascalCase** into **snake_case**.  

**Key Concepts:**
- 🔁 Iterating through strings  
- ✂️ String slicing & concatenation  
- 🐍 List Comprehension for cleaner, shorter code  

The project is built in two phases:  
1. Using a **for loop** to parse and convert the string.  
2. Rewriting the solution using **List Comprehension** to achieve the same result more concisely.
